### Input File Format

svZeroDSolver is configured using either a JSON file or a Python dictionary. JSON is a convenient file format to represent a dictionary-like object. More details can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/06/02/a-beginners-guide-to-json-the-data-format-for-the-internet/).

The top-level structure of both is:

```python
{
    "simulation_parameters": {...},
    "vessels": [...],
    "junctions": [...],
    "boundary_conditions": [...]
}
```

In the following sections, the individual categories are described in more
detail.

Examples of how blocks may be specified in a json configuration file can be found within each block's respective class documentation [here](https://simvascular.github.io/svZeroDSolver/annotated.html)

#### Simulation parameters

The svZeroDSolver can be configured with the following options in the
`simulation_parameters` section of the input file. Parameters without a
default value must be specified. an example of the simulation parameters in a json configuration file can be found [here](https://simvascular.github.io/svZeroDSolver/struct_simulation_parameters.html)

|Parameter key                                  | Description                                                 | Default value |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------|
|`number_of_cardiac_cycles` &emsp;              | Number of cardiac cycles to simulate &emsp;                        | - |
|`number_of_time_pts_per_cardiac_cycle` &emsp;  | Number of time steps per cardiac cycle &emsp;                      | - |
|`absolute_tolerance` &emsp;                    | Absolute tolerance for time integration &emsp;                    | $10^{-8}$ |
|`maximum_nonlinear_iterations` &emsp;          | Maximum number of nonlinear iterations for time integration &emsp; | $30$ |
|`steady_initial` &emsp;                        | Toggle whether to use the steady solution as the initial condition for the simulation &emsp; | true |
|`output_variable_based` &emsp;                 | Output solution based on variables (i.e. flow and pressure at nodes and internal variables) &emsp; | false |
|`output_interval` &emsp;                       | The frequency of writing timesteps to the output (1 means every timestep is written) &emsp; | $1$ |
|`output_mean_only` &emsp;                      | Write only the mean values over every timestep to output file &emsp; | false |
|`output_derivative` &emsp;                     | Write time derivatives to output file &emsp; | false |
|`output_all_cycles` &emsp;                     | Write all cardiac cycles to output file &emsp; | false |
|`use_cycle_to_cycle_error` &emsp;              | Use cycle-to-cycle error to determine number of cycles for convergence &emsp; | false |
|`sim_cycle_to_cycle_percent_error` &emsp;      | Percentage error threshold for cycle-to-cycle pressure and flow difference &emsp; | 1.0 |

The option `use_cycle_to_cycle_error` allows the solver to change the number of cardiac cycles it runs depending on the cycle-to-cycle convergence of the simulation. For simulations with no RCR boundary conditions, the simulation will add extra cardiac cycles until the difference between the mean pressure and flow in consecutive cycles is below the threshold set by `sim_cycle_to_cycle_percent_error` at all inlets and outlets of the model. If there is at least one RCR boundary condition, the number of cycles is determined based on equation 21 of <a href="#0d-Pfaller2021">Pfaller et al. (2021)</a>, using the RCR boundary condition with the largest time constant.

The above table describes the most commonly used boundary conditions. In addition, svZeroDSolver includes various closed-loop boundary conditions. See <a href="#0d-Menon2023">Menon et al. (2023)</a> for details of a closed-loop 0D model. Examples can also be found in `svZeroDSolver/tests/cases`.

Values of the boundary condition can be specified as a function of time as follow:
```python
{
    "bc_name": "INFLOW", # Name of the boundary condition
    "bc_type": "FLOW", # Type of the boundary condition
    "bc_values": {
        "Q": [ ..., ..., ... ], # Comma-separated list of values
        "t": [ ..., ..., ... ]  # Comma-separated list of corresponding time stamps
    }
},
```
See `svZeroDSolver/tests/cases/pulsatileFlow_R_RCR.json` for an example.
